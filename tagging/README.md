# /tagging — auditable quantitative layer

**Every numeric figure cited in `/essays` is regenerable from here.** If a number
in an essay can't be reproduced by running the script below, it's a bug — report it.

## Files
- `lexicons.json` — the exact token lists for each metric, plus the ad-strip
  markers and timestamp regex. Edit metrics **here**, never in code. Glosses
  document construct caveats and deliberate exclusions (e.g. "I mean" out of
  hedges, "creepy" out of disgust) with the reason.
- `count.py` — reads `lexicons.json`, runs it over `/transcripts`, writes
  `counts.json`. Strips ASR timestamp markers and (BC only) dynamically-inserted
  iHeart ad sentences before counting.
- `counts.json` — per-episode output: `words_after_strip`, `ad_words_stripped`,
  and for each metric **`raw` count and `per_1k` rate**. Raw counts are committed
  so small-n fragility is visible: a "12–0" dissociation is a whole-episode total
  from a compact lexicon — suggestive, not proof.

## Regenerate
```
python3 tagging/count.py              # rewrite counts.json for all 26 transcripts
python3 tagging/count.py casino       # print just the matching files to stdout
```

## Discipline (learned the hard way — see FINDINGS C3)
1. **Stand this up before citing figures, not after.** The first ad-hoc script
   had a case-sensitivity bug that undercounted sentence-initial "My"/"Me" and
   manufactured a spurious first-person "inversion" in the Casino Royale essay.
2. **Lexicon choice moves the numbers.** Including "creepy"/"cringe" in disgust
   lifts KJB's Casino Royale count 3→8 and erodes the H3 dissociation. The lists
   are frozen to the brief §7 tokens (hedges) and to recoil-at-the-object terms
   (disgust); changing them is a methodological decision, logged.
3. **These are crude regex passes over ASR text.** They are directional evidence.
   Hand-check a sample before resting a claim on any count — this is why H3 was
   demoted from a lexical to a hand-coded functional claim (essay 03).
4. **Report raw alongside rate**, always, so the reader can see the n.

`/tools/register_counts.py` is the superseded ad-hoc script, kept only for
provenance; do not cite its output. `tagging/count.py` is canonical.
